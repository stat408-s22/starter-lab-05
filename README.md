# Lab 05 - La Quinta is Spanish for next to Dennyâ€™s

_Due Monday March 8 by 5:00pm_

Work through Lab 05 at: [https://stat408-s22.github.io/labs/lab-05/lab-05-wrangling.html](https://stat408-s22.github.io/labs/lab-05/lab-05-wrangling.html) (also linked off of our [course calendar webpage](https://stat408-s22.github.io/calendar.html)). 

You will work on this lab in teams. 
The lab will guide you through cloning your team's Lab 04 repo (named `lab-05-wrangling-YOUR_TEAM_NAME`) from our [GitHub stat408-s22 organization](https://github.com/stat408-s22), adding your lab answers to the starter `lab-05.Rmd` file in your repo, knitting to a markdown (.md) file, then pushing your changes to GitHub. Your team's final answers -- both .Rmd and .md files -- should be pushed to GitHub prior to the due date. Labs will be graded in GitHub.
